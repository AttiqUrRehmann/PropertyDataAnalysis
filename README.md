# 🏡 Real Estate Data Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **real estate sales data** to extract meaningful **market insights** and build **predictive models** for property prices. The goal is to create **a structured dataset from raw real estate data**, visualize trends using **Tableau**, and apply **machine learning models** to predict future prices.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Processed and structured real estate data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified **pricing trends, demand patterns, and suburb-wise distributions**.
- **Visualization & Dashboarding:** Created **interactive Tableau dashboards** to display market insights.
- **Machine Learning Predictions:** Trained models to forecast **property prices** based on historical data.
